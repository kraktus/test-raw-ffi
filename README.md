# test-raw-ffi

Proof of concept of rust FFI bindings with `cxx`, to be autogenerated with [`cargo-extern-fn`](https://github.com/kraktus/cargo-extern-fn).

The concept is simple, for every public struct, creates a sibling struct `MyStructRaw` will all fields being public, and implement `MyStructRaw` <-> `StructRaw` by moving all fields, which should be cheap or even optimised out for most structs.

We then create a third struct `StructFFI` in the `cxx::bridge` so it can be passed by value across the language boundarie.

Implement all compatible methods of `Struct` to `StructFFI` by delegating their implementations to `Struct` and converting it on the fly.
